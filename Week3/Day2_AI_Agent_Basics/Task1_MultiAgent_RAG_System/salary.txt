Monthly salary is the fixed amount an employee earns each month.
Annual salary is calculated as:
Annual salary = (Monthly salary Ã— 12) - Deductions.
Deductions include income tax, provident fund, professional tax, and insurance premiums.
Gross salary is the total amount before deductions.
Net salary = Gross salary - Deductions.
Payslips are generated every month and show earnings, deductions, and net salary.
