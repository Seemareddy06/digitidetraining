Insurance benefits provide financial protection in case of health issues, accidents, or death.
Coverage defines what medical expenses, accidents, or risks are included.
Premium is the amount paid monthly or annually to keep the insurance active.
Claims are requests made to the insurance provider for coverage benefits.
The claim process usually requires submitting documents such as medical bills or accident reports.
Insurance helps reduce financial burden during emergencies.
